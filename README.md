# From_GAN_to_DCGAN

(Still in progress, the code is coming soon!!!)

## Introduction
This project aims at adressing a quick review on the principles of the generative adversarial network (GAN)  and its limits. Then we will implement a DCGAN network (Deep Convolutional GAN). This network will be used to generate NFT (Non-fungible token) images.

## Getting started
First of all, we will briefly return to the concept of the generative adversarial network, its architecture and its applications.
