# From_GAN_to_DCGAN

## Introduction
This project aims at adressing a quick review on the principles of the generative adversarial network (GAN)  and its limits. Then we will implement a DCGAN network (Deep Convolutional GAN). This network will be used to generate art and food images.

## Getting started
First of all, we will briefly return to the concept of the generative adversarial network, its architecture and its applications.


### GAN 
The objective of the GAN is to generate realistic data, which means plausible according to a probability
distribution of a real data. 

(README to update!!)


### DCGAN
